# Echo MCP Server

This folder contains an example implementation of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using Node.js. The server includes a simple tool called `echo_tool` that echoes back the input provided by the client.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

The `echo_tool` accepts a string input and returns the same string as output. This is useful for testing and understanding the basic functionality of an MCP server.
